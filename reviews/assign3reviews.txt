review: let's design the syntax for the second language first.

Update dsl.txt file to show what we want to create. Once we have the
syntax figured out, fluent and feasible, we can start implementing with tests.

We can remove some smell, see suggestion in code. After fixing, move

review: make sure the test fails before it passes

Notice warnings when rake is run.

Check the test. Write a failing test then make it pass.

review: I like where you're going with this

Very nice progress.

Drop the : in the test (line 17, for example) and see what happens.

In the first test, the new, ( and " are all noises. Let's see if we can
avoid those.
